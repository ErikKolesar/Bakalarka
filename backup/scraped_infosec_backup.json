Test-Driven Detection (TDD), which emphasizes test creation before writing detection logic, is emerging as a best practice. LLMs show promise in auditing and improving detector descriptions within CI/CD pipelines but aren't suitable for creating detection logic.",

Rego provides a flexible policy language which can make it easier to use but also may lead to language misuse, mis-evaluation, or performance considerations. OpenFGA provides a declarative language for mapping ReBAC constraints, which can simplify policy writing, but it relies on external attribute lists and can lead to unpredictable performance. The language also features mitigations for threats related to policy extension and replacement.",

Mature but not engineering-focused teams will often buy tooling from early-stage startups. Less mature teams will primarily wait for larger companies to adopt new tooling and features to reduce the amount of products they pay for. Startups need to be aware of these trends as they are the inverse of typical strategies. Security teams need to consider this cycle when deciding to build vs buy tooling.",

GCP suggests in its documentation that customers utilize the --extra-index-url argument when using PyPI packages from a private repository and follows this guidance internally as well. Tenable researchers discovered that when a package with the same name exists in a public and private repository, pip will prioritize the higher versioned package, whether private or public, and will prioritize the public repository if the package is pinned. This allowed Tenable to identify a package used by Cloud Composer that did not exist in the public PyPI repository and create it themselves, which could have led to RCE if used maliciously. Google has remediated the issue by switching to using the --index-url argument.",

The article also covers detection opportunities through PowerShell command execution and registry changes and suggests mitigation strategies for EDR vendors such as monitoring NRPT changes and implementing backup IP addresses for critical FQDNs.",

AWS recommends organizations prepare by making an inventory of their cryptography usage and upgrading to TLS 1.3.",
