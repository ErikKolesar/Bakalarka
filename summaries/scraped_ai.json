        "content": "Researchers have introduced a neural network structure called ControlNet, which can control pretrained large diffusion models to support additional input conditions. This new method allows for task-specific learning in an end-to-end fashion and is capable of learning with a small training dataset. The training is as fast as fine-tuning a diffusion model and can be done on a personal device, or it can scale to large amounts of data using powerful computation clusters. The researchers demonstrate that ControlNets can enable conditional inputs such as edge maps, segmentation maps, and key points for large diffusion models, which can benefit various related applications.",

In this paper, the authors introduce Collage Diffusion, a collage-conditional diffusion algorithm that allows users to control the spatial arrangement and visual attributes of objects in the scene. By defining a collage with an ordered sequence of layers, each with an RGBA image and corresponding text prompt, users can control image harmonization on a layer-by-layer basis and edit individual objects in generated images while keeping other objects fixed. Collage Diffusion modifies text-image cross-attention with alpha masks to ensure different parts of the input text correspond to the various locations specified in the input collage layers.

Shortly before Google introduced Bard, its AI chatbot, to the public in March, it asked employees to test the tool. One worker’s conclusion: Bard was “a pathological liar.” Another called it “cringe-worthy.” One employee wrote that when they asked Bard suggestions for how to land a plane, it regularly gave advice that would lead to a crash; another said it gave answers on scuba diving “which would likely result in serious injury or death.”",

However, even then it is often too expensive to fine-tune large (more than 13B parameter) models on commodity hardware. Quantization reduces the precision of parameters in the model which in turn takes less space. More great open source progress.",

Our research found that these models can be very receptive to the new information, provided it's coherent and convincing, but they also tend to confirm their existing 'knowledge' if the new data contains any elements that agree with it, a behavior known as confirmation bias. These findings are important for further improvements and applications of augmented LLMs.",

A cool fact is that if you concatenate two sentences and the gzip compression ratio doesn’t change much, the sentences are likely very similar.

It even works well on tasks it wasn't trained on and on LLMs of all sizes. The improved learning seems to come from the retriever finding similar examples to learn from.",

If we could use cheap additions instead, we could fit more transistors on the chip and potentially run with much less power. This is very early research, but the algorithm presented suggests we can use just additions for large matrix multiplications.",

It offers larger model capacity with lower costs by using a soft assignment method where each expert processes a subset of input tokens. SoftMoE outperforms standard Transformers and other MoE models in visual recognition tasks. It performs equally well compared to the ViT-Huge/14 model, but with a much lower inference cost. When scaled up, SoftMoE significantly increases model parameters while keeping inference time cost minimal, resulting in better performance. Plus, it's fully differentiable!",

This paper introduces a shift from simply generating commit messages to completing them using past commit history. The paper introduces a new dataset, CommitChronicle, and shows that using history can improve the quality of messages. It highlights the fact that the GPT-3.5-turbo model, while not always outperforming, has the potential for generating longer, detailed messages.",

This post presents the different sides of the argument to deepen people's understanding of the debate. Scaling has worked for other similar fields. However, it is impractical as there isn't much robotics data available and there's no clear way to get it. Even if scaling works as well as in other fields, it likely still won't solve robotics.",

        "content": "Benjamin Bratton, the director of the Antikythera program at the Berggruen Institute and a professor at the University of California, San Diego, discusses the global reaction to artificial intelligence as a “Copernican Trauma,\" equating it with past shifts that have redefined humanity's self-perception. Bratton proposes five stages of \"AI grief\" — denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance — to frame societal responses to AI's evolution, from skepticism to integration into our understanding of intelligence. He argues that the integration of AI reflects a broader biological and technological evolutionary process, rather than a distinctively human narrative.",

The technique works by converting structured formats into finite state machines and identifying redundant paths that lead to the same output, allowing them to skip unnecessary LLM calls. While it significantly improves speed, it is important to maintain output quality by ensuring the optimization doesn't prevent more probable sequences from being generated.",
