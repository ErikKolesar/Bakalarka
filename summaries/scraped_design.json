For example, Apple’s iPhone, one of the most popular consumer products of all time, is bloated with apps and settings leading to usability problems that Apple plans to solve with Spotlight — AI-powered search. Artificial intelligence that is built to “guide” a user will almost always prioritize the experience that the company wants you to have over the one that you’d like.",
