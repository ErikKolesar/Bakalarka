        "content": "The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly considering asking a court to force Google to sell its Chrome browser to curb the tech giant's search monopoly as Chrome's dominance disproportionately supports Google's broader market control. In addition to banning exclusive deals, the DOJ may push for greater data transparency, AI-related measures, and the separation of Android from Google's other products, though it will stop short of demanding an Android divestiture. Google plans to appeal the ruling. Experts warn that the proposed remedies could face legal challenges or potential interference from the incoming Trump administration.",

Human engineers prefer code that's abstracted and reused because we can only keep a few things in our heads at once, while AI can manage thousands of separate pieces with ease. Instead of forcing AI to write \"good\" code by human standards (DRY, abstracted, and component-based), perhaps we should embrace its preference for \"radically simple\" code—where each function does exactly one thing without complex interconnections. This approach might actually create more reliable software, even if it looks messy to our eyes.",

Then talk to your team and customers to understand why things were done certain ways before.

        "content": "The word \"but\" negates whatever comes before it, which is why most communication advice suggests avoiding it.
