To gauge if your product is actually marketable, ask yourself how many people are aware they have the problem being solved.

The more frequent the problem shows up, the more likely someone will pay to solve it. Finally, determine what the impact is of not solving the problem. If nothing bad happens when the problem goes unsolved, it’s a signal that no real market exists.

If your target audience has several questions about your products or services, a content frequency of 4-5 blogs per week may be required. If you operate in a specialized industry, you can turn to content creation 1-2 times a month. Tips for maintaining a regular publishing schedule include creating a feasible editorial calendar and mastering the art of repurposing content. Use videos to create new blog posts, combine old blog posts to create ebooks, and convert takeaways from reports into shareable infographics.",

The company rode the growing trend of flexitarianism to dominate the oat milk niche. Any brand can look for opportunities to expand beyond its category and look for new audiences to sell to (who might not even be looking for the product).",

        "content": "Most marketing today works by grabbing attention, making you emotional, and turning emotion into action. For this to work, your audience has to trust, like, and relate to you – which is where humor comes into play. One tactic is to make fun of yourself, as IKEA did with a playfully misassembled ad. You can also make extreme and humorous analogies to show how your customer’s life would look without your product. Alternatively, brands can take a bold stance against something in their industry they don’t agree with, as Verizon did with its “one size does not fit all” messaging.",

If a CTA is placed above-the-fold, ensure it aligns with the reading pattern. However, don't always stick to placing CTAs there, as below-the-fold may work better for complex offers. It's important to test. Don't place unrelated content, ads, or social media buttons near a CTA.",

        "content": "A new study found that viewers' income and likelihood of buying a product were not factors that determined how much it costs to reach them — it's how active they are on the platforms where the ads run. More active audiences command a lower advertising price per impression, while groups that don't tune in as often cost a premium to advertise to. As a result, TV advertisers pay more to reach young men who watch TV infrequently and pay less to reach women and older groups, whereas on platforms such as Instagram and TikTok, older audiences can be more expensive to reach. This scarcity factor explains why broadcast and cable advertising revenue largely held steady from 2014 to 2019, even as more people moved over to streaming services.",

Only direct users to schedule a demo if it's actually necessary for them to understand the product — if so, explain to visitors what a demo will entail. If it's not possible to provide specific pricing information on your site, then explain the factors that go into it rather than simply telling users to call to find out. Extraordinary claims (without proof) and unrealistic stock imagery leave visitors questioning rather than trusting. Avoid asking for information in forms that isn't actually necessary.",

Factor in “hot” emotional states, like hunger or frustration, in advertising while also framing your product as the solution.

Low word counts in a SERP of all blog posts usually indicate that a more robust blog post could overtake them. If the content winning the keyword is outdated, either based on the title signifier or the information itself, then it's likely a more timely article could win. Content that takes forever to deliver on search intent (or barely addresses it) probably sends poor user experience signals, which provides another opportunity to take over the keyword ranking.",

Medium-sized companies add new products and/or sub-brands, so they lose some focus but can still crush scissors with their momentum. Large companies have more product lines, which allows them to cover rocks with their resources, but still lose to hyper-focused scissors.

Mid-roll ads placed earlier in episodes yield the best visitor rates, outperforming pre- and post-roll spots. Ads longer than 60 seconds show higher conversion rates, and episodic buys, where ads run in a single episode for at least 30 days, perform better than impression-based campaigns. Ad stacking reduces effectiveness. Health, fitness, and education podcasts achieve the highest visitor rates, while fashion and retail excel in cost-per-acquisition efficiency.",

Testimonials from customers proved more effective than company-provided data points - conversions dropped 10% when data replaced testimonials. This highlights that people trust individuals more than corporations. Visitor intent also plays a critical role, as social proof is most effective for new visitors but may be less relevant for returning customers. To maximize the results of your own tests, base changes on data insights rather than assumptions and test the modifications thoroughly. After implementing changes, compare pre- and post-test data to identify potential unintended consequences.",

For every day a delivery arrives early, return rates rise by 3.8%, with new customers seeing a 4.26% increase per early day. High-priced items are more likely to be returned, while popular ones are less affected. The effect stems from cognitive dissonance; rapid deliveries leave buyers doubting their decisions. To reduce returns, retailers should provide accurate delivery windows, offer slower shipping options, and send post-purchase communications emphasizing product benefits.",

        "content": "In B2C subscription businesses, high retention rates can signal over-targeting core personas and missing growth opportunities. Accepting some early churn allows experimentation with broader audiences, increasing long-term revenue potential. The goal is to elevate the cohort floor - where churn stabilizes - by retaining customers after the initial drop-off. For example, Hulu raised its floor from 20% to 30%, which boosted its profitability. Retention strategies differ by churn timing. Early churn often points to onboarding issues, while later churn may require solving product-related problems like content gaps.",

This strategy aligned with the psychological principle of goal dilution, which states that brands claiming to do too many things become less believable. Companies should avoid goal dilution by prioritizing a single goal and ensuring all messaging supports it.

Experiential gifting, where brands provide influencers with over-the-top experiences instead of traditional sponsorships, makes marketing spend highly visible, potentially sparking negative sentiment. As customer-first marketing gains traction, brands prioritizing real consumer engagement over influencer spectacle may better align with shifting expectations.",

        "content": "Startups launching a two-sided marketplace must solve the “chicken-and-egg” problem by attracting both supply and demand. Tinder's co-founder Whitney Wolfe recruited 15,000 initial users by targeting sororities first, then presenting the app to fraternities. Airbnb gained its first 6,000 landlords by scraping Craigslist for listings and emailing landlords with a compelling pitch. Uber secured early drivers by offering guaranteed pay and attracted riders by providing free rides at tech events, relying on word-of-mouth marketing. Successful startups prioritize early user satisfaction, ensuring they become advocates who drive organic growth.",

        "content": "AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude are changing how people find information, but monetizing them is challenging. Google earns about $54 billion per quarter from search ads, which works because they target user intent at minimal cost per query. However, AI chatbots are expensive to run—each response costs several cents, while Google searches cost fractions of a cent. Traditional ad models don't fit well in chatbots, leading companies like OpenAI to rely on subscriptions, API sales, and enterprise solutions. Despite millions of paying users, AI firms like OpenAI and Anthropic are still losing billions annually, making profitability uncertain without major cost reductions or new monetization strategies.",
