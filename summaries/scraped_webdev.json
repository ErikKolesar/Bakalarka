Prompt ensembles are sets of diverse prompts that are meant to solve the same problem. To improve LLM reliability, we can generate an answer to a question by querying the LLM with multiple different input prompts and considering each of the model’s responses when inferring a final answer. The basic idea behind these techniques is simple and can drastically improve LLM performance, making prompt ensembles a go-to approach for improving LLM reliability.",

When a Figma design is opened, the browser downloads a “Fig file” which essentially contains compressed JSON, though much more optimized. These files are put in S3 and when they are opened, they’re opened on the server too. Instead of writing back the entire file on each change, clients stream back only the changed data. The server applies those changes to its own in-memory copy to keep it synchronized.",

JWT on the other hand, stores this information in the client, which does not depend on server connection and is very fast. However once a JWT token is signed, there’s no way to invalidate it until the token expires, making permission updates and logging out complicated.",

Weak consistency, which prioritizes high availability and low latency, may or may not return the latest data. The choice of consistency pattern depends on the system requirements and use cases.",

It turns out that there's a whole underground world of people who share credit card parameters with the biggest likelihood of creating a card that’s accepted on a specific website (usually some SaaS). The cost of this fraudulent activity (starting with payment processor fees, chargeback penalties, engineering costs, and even the risk of getting deplatformed) is being paid by businesses around the world. Stripe charging businesses a £20 chargeback fee is another example of unfair treatment. All of these costs are eventually offloaded onto customers as higher prices.",

Components, directives, or pipes placed within a defer block are loaded based on specific conditions or events, allowing for lazy loading. Defer blocks can be enhanced with @loading, @placeholder, and @error blocks for a more comprehensive user experience. This article uses code examples to explain the many ways defer blocks can be used.",

It does not push any framework-specific runtime library code to the client’s browser, thus resulting in better performance.",

The web is open and therefore cannot be locked down by corporations. Each company has different incentives when it comes to users, which can lead to Google not fixing certain bugs and Apple being strict about the capabilities of developers on its devices. A strategy for dealing with this is reducing your dependence on big company products when they try to put you in a zero-sum game and re-engaging more with them if they're willing to be more symbiotic.",

They are a good way to access thoughtful long-form content without the distractions often found on social media platforms.

They are a relic of the “old web” in today’s algorithm-dominated world, but as AI floods algorithms, RSS may make a comeback.",

        "content": "This article compares Rust's memory safety with C++ by illustrating a scenario involving an internal library written in Rust. Initially, the author used Rust's “Rc” type for reference counting but encountered thread safety issues. Upon switching to Rust's “Arc” type, which provides atomic reference counting, the compiler enforced thread safety, ensuring data race conditions were prevented at compile time. C++ lacks such safety features, relying on developers to manually handle thread safety, which can lead to subtle bugs and undefined behavior. Rust's borrow checker and type system statically prevents data races, making it unique among programming languages.",

        "content": "While logs and queues share temporal ordering, they differ fundamentally. Queues adhere to a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, allowing for sequential consumption from the head or tail. In contrast, logs require readers to maintain a pointer and read by position rather than by order of arrival. This distinction leads to advantages in scalability when implementing logs as queues, particularly in enabling parallel consumption and efficient load distribution among multiple consumers without necessitating knowledge of the internal structure. Additionally, queues offer benefits such as replay and durability, explored in detail in the article.",

With E2E tests, you have control over the page but deal with pain points like the inability to make assertions on mocks and test segments of the app. SafeTest aims to address these issues by having a snippet of code in the application bootstrapping stage that injects hooks to run tests. It uses Playwright to run regular tests, thereby achieving ideal browser control.

The L2 cache is larger but slower. It deals with cache lines (groups of bytes) and handles most communication between the CPU core and other components. The L3 cache is even larger and slower, serving as a shared resource for multiple cores and handling less frequent requests.",

However, learning C can provide great insights into computer architecture and operating systems, as the C abstract machine closely maps to these elements. For programmers primarily using higher-level languages, learning C can be valuable to understanding how their code interacts with the underlying machine.",

Cassandra, which is being actively improved by Apple engineers, handles exabytes of data and millions of queries. FoundationDB powers CloudKit, Apple's cloud backend service. It provides key features like transactional guarantees and solves scalability issues that Cassandra alone could not address. Each iCloud user gets their own database, resulting in billions of databases. This is made possible by the Record Layer's stateless architecture and resource allocation using a “record store” abstraction.",

This involves tokenization to identify HTML elements, building the DOM tree to represent the structure, and creating the CSSOM tree for styling.

These patterns can happen through various transport methods, such as WebSockets and Server-Sent Events. Pub/Sub providers are recommended to be used when distributing updates across multiple server instances.",

The phone reboot was actually caused by an infinite loop continuously taking screen snapshots, easily bypassed by using `thread return` in LLDB to skip the offending function. Finally, the code injection crash is from the app's reliance on an app group that gets removed during resigning, which was fixed by avoiding resigning or using a jailbroken device.",
